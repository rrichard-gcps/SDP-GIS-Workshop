# GIS With R: 
## Strategic Data Project Joint Winter Workshop 2019
This repository contains web guides, R code, and sample
data to help education data analysts answer questions about geographic location and spatial processes in education. 
This material can also be accessed on the
OpenSDP website at [opensdp.github.io/analysis](https://opensdp.github.io/analysis).

The code in this repository is based on code from the "Analyze" section of the
[Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use).

This repository is organized in the following folder structure:

- `code` contains the R code of the analysis (and renders the guide)
- `R` contains R functions necessary to complete the analysis
- `data` contains data necessary to complete the analysis
- `img` contains images to format the guides
- `includes` contains style assets to format the guides
- `man` contains the manuals and descriptive files of the data

These materials were originally authored by **Roland Richard**.

[OpenSDP](https://opensdp.github.io) is an online, public repository of analytic
code, tools, and training intended to foster collaboration among education
analysts and researchers in order to accelerate the improvement of our school
systems. The community is hosted by the
[Strategic Data Project](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu), an initiative of the
[Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard University](https://cepr.harvard.edu).
We welcome contributions and feedback.
